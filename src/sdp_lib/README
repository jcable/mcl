SinisterSdp - An open source Session Description Protocol library.
------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

SinisterSdp is an open source ANSI C library that parses and generates Session
Description Protocol session descriptions for multimedia streaming and VoIP
(Voice over Internet Protocol). The Session Description Protocol is described
in RFC 2327 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2327.txt).

INSTALLATION

To install, go to the ./src subdirectory and run the following commands:

 $ make
 $ make install
 $ make clean

The makefile takes a few options, most notably: LIBRARY_DESTINATION and
HEADER_DESTINATION. The first is the path to the directory where the resulting
*.a archive will go, and the second is the path to where the main SinisterSdp.h
header file will go and where a ./SDP sub directory will be created to store
the rest of the header files.

There are several more options too. Read the Makefile for details.

There is also an alternate target you can specify to just build the generator
by itself if you need only that. (The parser utilizes the generator, so you can
build the generator without the parser but not the other way around).

GETTING STARTED

See the SinisterSdp.html file for info on how to get started.
