Changelog for SinisterSdp.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[0.80]
Fixed two infinite loop bugs in _ParseContactField(). Also fixed the
SDP_AssertTrue() macro, and fixed a memory leak in _ParseRepeatTimeField().
The SinisterSdpDescriptions documentation has been improved too.

[0.75]
Heavily cleaned up the Parser code. Added error codes specific to each type of
field and added more error checking in general. The SDP_EventStreamParser
module was also improved. Many more comments were added as well.

[0.70]
Moved the linked list macros from SDP_Utility.h to their own header file,
SDP_LinkedList. Also created a new internal struct similar to SDP_Str to
encapsulate lists with few other macros to manipulate it. Moved some of the
string manipulation code from SDP_Generator.c to SDP_Str.c, and flushed out the
SDP_Str module more.

[0.60]
Shipping now with documentation in HTML and POD format.

[0.50]
Fixed up some of the generator functions, and also added functions to generate
from each type of structure. Also added custom assertion macros and sprinkled
calls to them throughout the code.

[0.40]
Added a large module to encapsulate the structures used to store parsed values
from a description. This module provides New(), Get(), Set(), and Destroy()
functions for each object. Also moved _SplitField() into its own module,
SDP_StreamTokenizer. 

[0.07]

Initial release.
