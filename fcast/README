     FCAST: Multicast File Transfert Application over MCL Lib
		(as defined in the ALC internet draft)
    
	       README - Vincent Roca, Julien LABOURE
     -----------------------------------------------------------


1- USING THE FCAST TOOLS
-------------------

	./fcast -help
		for a list of commands/parameters available.
	
	Sample:
	    as Sender:    ./fcast -send -a230.1.2.3/1234 send.me
		Sends the file send.me to 230.1.2.3/1234 multicast group.

	    as Seceiver:  ./fcast -recv -a230.1.2.3/1234
		Get and save to current directory file(s)
		(and folders if recursive mode is ON) from
		230.1.2.3/1234 multicast group.

NOTES
----

	Note about recursive mode for directories transferts :
		This mode allows to send recusrively a directory with all files
		and subdirs.
		The arborescence is created in the receiver current directory.
		ie:
		 1/ if we use -r "../foo/" as sender parameter, then fcast will
		send all files and subdirs in "../foo/" from current dir
		On receiver side, a "foo/" directory will be created in current
		dir and filled with the corresponding files.
		
		 2/ if we use -r "/home/user/foo/" as sender parameter, then
		on receiver side, a "home/user/foo/ directory will be created
		in current dir and filled with the corresponding files.
		
		THIS MODE IS CURRENTLY NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED, so you *may* 
		notice some bugs, or hasardous results if tool is used in 
		non-standard ways...
		ie: ./fcast -send -r ~/../$HOME/././foo/  *MAY* not work :-)
		
		Also, files modes/permissions are not supported at the moment.
